                <p>"Last night,
every other thing dissolved
the noise, the past, the fear it
all faded beneath your smile.

It offset everything.
Like a calm in the eye of a storm,
it rewrote the day,
and I,
I stood still,
wishing time would do the same.

I tried to hold the moment
clutch it in trembling hands,
slow the rush of it,
but still,
I’m falling.

Too deep.
Too fast.
Like gravity found a shortcut
to my heart.

Is this alright?
This terrifying sweetness,
this ache I welcome?
If it's wrong,
don’t correct it.
Just let me fall
until the sky forgets
which way is up."</p>

                <p>"I like you— or maybe love, more than my own silence dares to admit. But though my heart beats for you, it still carries the weight of yesterday's sorrows, bruises that ache quietly beneath the surface.
I long to give you all of me, yet fragments of my soul still wander in the shadows of what once broke me.
Believe me when I say my love is real, fierce, and unwavering-but I am not yet ready to lay it bare. So I ask of you, not with fear but with hope: wait for me.
Wait until the day I rise from my ruins whole, unshaken, and entirely yours."</p>

                <p>"You might not know this, and I don't always find the words to say it, but I want you to know how deeply I appreciate you. From waiting patiently for me in the mornings, to showing up at my house almost every night just to spend time with me... from giving me the space to think when I need it, to embracing my feelings with such understanding, you've given me a safe place where I can bare my heart without fear.
I notice the little things too—the way you're sensitive to what I need, how you make sure I'm always comfortable when we're together, and how your love shows not just in words but in the quiet, thoughtful actions you do every day. I couldn't ask for more.
And if someday life leads us down different paths, I want you to remember this: I see you, I feel the love you pour into every gesture, and I will always be grateful for every bit of it."</p>

                <p>" Despite everything that has happened the good days and the bad you still choose to stay by my side, and for that, I’m so thankful. You could have just left me, yet here we are, still trying to hold on.
I just want to let you know how much I love you. I tell you that every day, but today is special, It’s been a month since we became official. I hope this lasts a lifetime, though it sounds idealistic. Still, for as long as we can, let’s keep holding on.
I’d choose you every single day. I won’t say much more, time will tell — but I’ll be by your side for as long as I can, for as long as you’ll let me.
I love you so much, baby. 🫶🏽🫶🏽"</p>
